    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

    <p>
      Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
      are slightly exaggerated.
    </p>

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

    <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
    </p>

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.

    <p>
      In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
      Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background-color: #ccc;">
      <p>
        <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
        <br>
        â€”Abraham Lincoln
      </p>
    </blockquote>
